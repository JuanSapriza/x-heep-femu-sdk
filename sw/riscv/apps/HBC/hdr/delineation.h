 * R_peak_extract 			(Done with external function, for example pan-tompkin)

 *		V
 * delineation_rr_extract 	(find the other points)

 *		V
 * delineation_correction 	(correct possible errors and inaccuracies)
 *		|
 *		V
 * triang_wave_onoff		(calculate onset and offset points for triangular waves)
